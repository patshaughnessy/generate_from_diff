Create a Rails 3 generator from git commit history. Example:

  rails generate generator_from_diff my_change HEAD~1 HEAD

This will generate a new Rails 3 generator called "my_change" using a "git diff" command with the
specified git revisions. When the my_change generator is later run the code changes will be
applied using Larry Wall's GNU patch command to whatever files are present.

This is a way of recording code changes made in one Rails project, and playing them back
in another.
